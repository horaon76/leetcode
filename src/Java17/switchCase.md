In Java 17, the `switch` statement has been enhanced to include **pattern matching**, which simplifies the syntax and improves readability. This enhancement allows you to use more flexible case labels and eliminates the need for explicit casting.

### New Syntax for Switch Case in Java 17

1. **Traditional Switch Statement**:
   The traditional switch statement looks like this:
   ```java
   int day = 3;
   String dayType;

   switch (day) {
       case 1:
       case 7:
           dayType = "Weekend";
           break;
       case 2:
       case 3:
       case 4:
       case 5:
       case 6:
           dayType = "Weekday";
           break;
       default:
           dayType = "Invalid day";
           break;
   }

   System.out.println(dayType); // Output: Weekday
   ```

2. **Enhanced Switch with Pattern Matching**:
   With the new pattern matching for switch statements, you can use a more concise syntax. Here's how it works:
   ```java
   // Define a method to get day type using enhanced switch
   public static String getDayType(int day) {
       return switch (day) {
           case 1, 7 -> "Weekend"; // Multiple case labels in a single line
           case 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -> "Weekday";
           default -> "Invalid day";
       };
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
       int day = 3;
       System.out.println(getDayType(day)); // Output: Weekday
   }
   ```

### Key Features of Enhanced Switch

1. **Arrow Syntax (`->`)**: You can use the arrow syntax to define the outcome of each case, which eliminates the need for the `break` statement.

2. **Multiple Case Labels**: You can combine multiple case labels in a single line using commas, making the code cleaner.

3. **Expression or Statement**: The enhanced switch can return a value (expression) or be used as a statement, providing flexibility in usage.

4. **No Fall-through**: Since each case can produce a result and the flow doesn't fall through to the next case, the code is less prone to errors.

### Example with Pattern Matching

While pattern matching in switch is still a preview feature in Java 17, it allows for more expressive handling of various data types, such as classes. Below is a conceptual example (note that full support for this feature may require enabling preview features):

```java
public class ShapeExample {

    // Define a sealed class hierarchy for shapes
    public sealed interface Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {
        double area();
    }

    public record Circle(double radius) implements Shape {
        @Override
        public double area() {
            return Math.PI * radius * radius;
        }
    }

    public record Rectangle(double width, double height) implements Shape {
        @Override
        public double area() {
            return width * height;
        }
    }

    // Method to calculate area using pattern matching in switch
    public static double calculateArea(Shape shape) {
        return switch (shape) {
            case Circle c -> c.area(); // Pattern matching
            case Rectangle r -> r.area();
        };
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circle = new Circle(5);
        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle(4, 6);

        System.out.println("Circle Area: " + calculateArea(circle)); // Output: Circle Area: 78.53981633974483
        System.out.println("Rectangle Area: " + calculateArea(rectangle)); // Output: Rectangle Area: 24.0
    }
}
```

### Summary

The enhanced switch statement in Java 17 introduces a more expressive and concise way to write switch cases, leveraging new features such as the arrow syntax and the ability to handle multiple cases together. This feature not only improves readability but also reduces boilerplate code, making it easier to maintain and understand.
