Here's a table outlining the differences between an **interface** and an **abstract class** in Java, followed by an example and guidance on when to use each.

| Feature                       | Interface                                        | Abstract Class                                   |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**                | A contract that defines methods that a class must implement. | A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation). |
| **Method Implementation**     | Cannot have method implementations (Java 8 and later allows default and static methods). | Can have both abstract methods and concrete methods. |
| **Constructor**               | Cannot have constructors.                         | Can have constructors.                           |
| **Multiple Inheritance**      | Supports multiple inheritance (a class can implement multiple interfaces). | Does not support multiple inheritance (a class can extend only one abstract class). |
| **Access Modifiers**          | All methods are implicitly public (cannot have other access modifiers). | Can have various access modifiers (public, protected, private). |
| **Fields**                    | Cannot have instance variables (can have static final variables). | Can have instance variables and static variables. |
| **Use Case**                  | Used to represent a contract for what a class can do (capabilities). | Used to share common behavior among closely related classes. |

### Example

#### Interface Example
```java
public interface Payment {
    void processPayment(double amount); // Abstract method
}
```

#### Abstract Class Example
```java
public abstract class AbstractPayment {
    protected String paymentMethod;

    public AbstractPayment(String paymentMethod) {
        this.paymentMethod = paymentMethod;
    }

    public abstract void processPayment(double amount); // Abstract method

    public void displayMethod() { // Concrete method
        System.out.println("Payment Method: " + paymentMethod);
    }
}
```

#### Implementing the Interface and Abstract Class
```java
public class CreditCardPayment implements Payment {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing credit card payment of: $" + amount);
    }
}

public class PayPalPayment extends AbstractPayment {
    public PayPalPayment() {
        super("PayPal");
    }

    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing PayPal payment of: $" + amount);
    }
}
```

### Usage Example
```java
public class PaymentTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Payment ccPayment = new CreditCardPayment();
        ccPayment.processPayment(150.00); // Output: Processing credit card payment of: $150.0

        PayPalPayment paypalPayment = new PayPalPayment();
        paypalPayment.displayMethod(); // Output: Payment Method: PayPal
        paypalPayment.processPayment(75.50); // Output: Processing PayPal payment of: $75.5
    }
}
```

### When to Use

- **Use an Interface when**:
    - You want to define a contract that multiple classes can implement, regardless of their position in the class hierarchy.
    - You want to achieve multiple inheritance since a class can implement multiple interfaces.
    - You are defining capabilities or behaviors that can be shared among unrelated classes.

- **Use an Abstract Class when**:
    - You want to provide a common base class for related classes, allowing them to share code and fields.
    - You need to define some default behavior for subclasses while leaving some methods abstract for subclasses to implement.
    - You want to define constructors to initialize fields.

By understanding the differences and use cases for interfaces and abstract classes, you can make more informed design decisions in your Java applications.

Let's consider an example related to **a Vehicle Management System**. This example will demonstrate the use of both an interface and an abstract class in the context of different types of vehicles.

### Example: Vehicle Management System

#### Step 1: Define the Interface

The interface `Vehicle` will define common behaviors that all vehicles must implement.

```java
public interface Vehicle {
    void start(); // Method to start the vehicle
    void stop();  // Method to stop the vehicle
    int getNumberOfWheels(); // Method to get the number of wheels
}
```

#### Step 2: Define the Abstract Class

The abstract class `AbstractVehicle` will provide a base for all specific vehicle types and may include common fields and methods.

```java
public abstract class AbstractVehicle implements Vehicle {
    protected String brand;
    protected String model;

    public AbstractVehicle(String brand, String model) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
    }

    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Brand: " + brand + ", Model: " + model);
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Create Concrete Classes

Now, let's create two concrete classes that extend the abstract class and implement the interface.

```java
public class Car extends AbstractVehicle {
    private int numberOfWheels = 4; // Cars typically have 4 wheels

    public Car(String brand, String model) {
        super(brand, model);
    }

    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Starting the car: " + brand + " " + model);
    }

    @Override
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Stopping the car: " + brand + " " + model);
    }

    @Override
    public int getNumberOfWheels() {
        return numberOfWheels;
    }
}

public class Motorcycle extends AbstractVehicle {
    private int numberOfWheels = 2; // Motorcycles typically have 2 wheels

    public Motorcycle(String brand, String model) {
        super(brand, model);
    }

    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Starting the motorcycle: " + brand + " " + model);
    }

    @Override
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Stopping the motorcycle: " + brand + " " + model);
    }

    @Override
    public int getNumberOfWheels() {
        return numberOfWheels;
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Using the Classes

Here's how we can use these classes in our vehicle management system.

```java
public class VehicleManagementSystem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle car = new Car("Toyota", "Camry");
        Vehicle motorcycle = new Motorcycle("Yamaha", "YZF-R3");

        car.start(); // Output: Starting the car: Toyota Camry
        motorcycle.start(); // Output: Starting the motorcycle: Yamaha YZF-R3

        car.displayInfo(); // Output: Brand: Toyota, Model: Camry
        motorcycle.displayInfo(); // Output: Brand: Yamaha, Model: YZF-R3

        System.out.println("Car wheels: " + car.getNumberOfWheels()); // Output: Car wheels: 4
        System.out.println("Motorcycle wheels: " + motorcycle.getNumberOfWheels()); // Output: Motorcycle wheels: 2

        car.stop(); // Output: Stopping the car: Toyota Camry
        motorcycle.stop(); // Output: Stopping the motorcycle: Yamaha YZF-R3
    }
}
```

### Summary

In this **Vehicle Management System** example:

- **Interface**: The `Vehicle` interface defines the contract that all vehicle types (like `Car` and `Motorcycle`) must follow. It ensures that all vehicles can be started, stopped, and can provide the number of wheels.

- **Abstract Class**: The `AbstractVehicle` class provides shared attributes (like `brand` and `model`) and common methods (like `displayInfo()`) for all specific vehicle types. It implements the `Vehicle` interface and provides a foundation for all concrete vehicle classes.

### When to Use

- **Use an Interface**: When you want to ensure that various classes provide specific functionalities (like starting and stopping) without enforcing a specific class hierarchy.

- **Use an Abstract Class**: When you have common behaviors or properties that can be shared among multiple classes while allowing some flexibility for subclasses to provide their own implementations for certain methods.
