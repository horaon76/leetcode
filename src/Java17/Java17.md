Java 17, released in September 2021, is a long-term support (LTS) version that introduced several new features and enhancements to the language. Below are some key features and improvements, along with explanations and examples.

### Key Features of Java 17

1. **Sealed Classes and Interfaces**:
    - Sealed classes allow you to define a class hierarchy with a controlled set of subclasses. This feature improves type safety and reduces the risk of unintended subclassing.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {
   }

   public final class Circle extends Shape {
       // Circle implementation
   }

   public final class Rectangle extends Shape {
       // Rectangle implementation
   }
   ```

2. **Pattern Matching for `instanceof`**:
    - This feature simplifies the code by eliminating the need for explicit casting when using the `instanceof` operator.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   public void process(Object obj) {
       if (obj instanceof String s) {
           System.out.println("String length: " + s.length());
       } else {
           System.out.println("Not a string");
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Records**:
    - Records provide a compact way to create data classes. They automatically generate methods like `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   public record Person(String name, int age) {
       // Additional methods can be added
   }

   Person person = new Person("Alice", 30);
   System.out.println(person); // Output: Person[name=Alice, age=30]
   ```

4. **New `java.nio.file` Features**:
    - The `java.nio.file` package introduced several improvements, including the ability to read and write files with better performance and easier API usage.

5. **Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator)**:
    - This API allows Java programs to interoperate with native code (C, C++) and manage memory outside the Java heap. It's designed to provide a safer and more efficient way to call native functions.

6. **JEP 411: Deprecate the Security Manager for Removal**:
    - The Security Manager and its associated API have been deprecated for future removal, signaling a shift towards alternative security models.

7. **JEP 382: New macOS Rendering Pipeline**:
    - A new rendering pipeline for macOS has been introduced, improving the performance of Java applications on macOS by leveraging the Apple Metal API.

8. **JEP 390: Warnings for Value-Based Classes**:
    - This feature adds warnings when value-based classes (like `Optional`) are used in a way that may not align with their intended usage.

9. **JEP 392: Enhance `switch` with Pattern Matching** (Preview):
    - This feature enhances the `switch` statement to support pattern matching, allowing for more expressive and concise code.

10. **JEP 393: Improved `type` for `switch` Statements**:
    - This allows `switch` statements to be more flexible with their case labels, improving the readability of complex switch statements.

### Other Notable Changes

- **Performance Improvements**: Various optimizations have been made to improve the performance of the JVM and the language.
- **New APIs**: Several new APIs have been introduced, along with updates to existing ones, improving usability and functionality.
- **Removal of RMI Activation**: RMI Activation has been removed from the Java SE platform, as it's considered less relevant in modern application architectures.

### Example of Using Multiple Features in Java 17

Hereâ€™s a combined example demonstrating records, sealed classes, and pattern matching:

```java
// Sealed class hierarchy for shapes
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {
    public abstract double area();
}

public final class Circle extends Shape {
    private final double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

public final class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private final double width;
    private final double height;

    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

// Record to hold shape information
public record ShapeInfo(Shape shape) {
    public String getDescription() {
        return "Shape area: " + shape.area();
    }
}

// Main class to demonstrate features
public class Java17FeaturesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circle = new Circle(5);
        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle(4, 6);

        ShapeInfo circleInfo = new ShapeInfo(circle);
        ShapeInfo rectangleInfo = new ShapeInfo(rectangle);

        System.out.println(circleInfo.getDescription()); // Output: Shape area: 78.53981633974483
        System.out.println(rectangleInfo.getDescription()); // Output: Shape area: 24.0
    }
}
```

### When to Use Java 17 Features

- **Use Records** when you need to create simple, immutable data classes that primarily serve as carriers for data.
- **Use Sealed Classes** when you want to restrict the inheritance of a class and ensure that all subclasses are known and controlled.
- **Use Pattern Matching** to simplify type checks and casting, making your code cleaner and less error-prone.

### Conclusion

Java 17 brings many powerful features and enhancements that improve the developer experience and increase the expressiveness of the language. By utilizing records, sealed classes, and other new features, you can write more efficient, maintainable, and type-safe code. If you're working on new Java projects, consider leveraging these features to enhance your application architecture.
