To help you visualize the recursive `dp` function from the solution above, we can represent its execution as a **tree of recursive calls**. Each node in the tree represents a state of the recursive function `dp(i, k)`, where:
- `i` is the current house index,
- `k` is the number of mailboxes remaining to be placed.

### Visual Representation of the DP Function:
Let's break this down step by step.

### High-Level Structure:

1. The `dp(i, k)` function tries to minimize the total cost of placing `k` mailboxes starting from the `i`-th house.
2. For each call to `dp(i, k)`, we try placing one mailbox for the subarray starting from house `i` to `j` (where `j >= i`), compute the cost for that subarray, and recursively solve the rest of the problem for the remaining houses (`dp(j+1, k-1)`).
3. The function memoizes the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

### Recursive Tree Breakdown:
Assume you have the following input:
- `houses = [1, 4, 8, 10, 20]`
- `k = 3` (3 mailboxes)

### Root Call: `dp(0, 3)`
This is the initial call where we are considering placing all 3 mailboxes starting from the first house (`houses[0]`).

At this point, we can:
- Place the first mailbox at any subarray `[0, j]`, where `j` ranges from `0` to `4` (all possible positions).
- After placing the first mailbox, recursively calculate the minimum cost to place the remaining `2` mailboxes for the houses after `j`.

```
                        dp(0, 3)
                          /|\ 
                   --------------------
                   |        |        |
                dp(1,2)  dp(2,2)  dp(3,2) ...
               /  |  \   /  |  \   /  |  \
          dp(2,1) dp(3,1) ...  ...
          .
          .
```

### First Branch: Placing the First Mailbox (`dp(0, 3)`)

Let's follow one possible branch where the first mailbox is placed optimally for houses `[1, 4, 8]` (`j = 2`):
- **Cost for subarray `[0, 2]`:** We precompute the cost for placing a mailbox optimally between `houses[0]` to `houses[2]` (i.e., [1, 4, 8]).

Then we call:
- **Recursive call `dp(3, 2)`:** Find the minimum cost of placing 2 mailboxes starting from house 3 (`houses[3] = 10`).

### Second Branch: `dp(3, 2)`
Now, we place the second mailbox optimally for the subarray starting from house 3.

Possible placements:
- Place a mailbox between `houses[3]` to `houses[4]` (i.e., `[10, 20]`) and calculate the cost for this subarray.

Finally, we call:
- **Recursive call `dp(5, 1)`:** With no houses left, return 0.

### Recursive Call Breakdown:

For each level of recursion, the function attempts to minimize the cost of placing mailboxes across all subarrays. Each node in the recursion tree can be visualized as:
- A branch where the current mailbox is placed between `i` and `j`, and
- The recursive branches for placing the remaining mailboxes for the rest of the houses.

### Complete Breakdown (Simplified Example):

Let’s visualize the recursive tree for a simplified example `houses = [1, 4, 8, 10, 20]` and `k = 3`:

```
                        dp(0, 3)
                          /|\ 
              --------------------------------
              |              |              |
           dp(1,2)        dp(2,2)         dp(3,2)
           /   |   \       /   |   \        /   |   \
       dp(2,1) dp(3,1)  dp(3,1) dp(4,1) dp(4,1) dp(5,1)
       /   \     . . .      . . .        . . .     .
   dp(3,0) dp(4,0) . . .     . . .        . . .     .
   
```

- **Root (`dp(0, 3)`):** The first mailbox can be placed at any subarray from house `0` to `j`. The function will explore all possible placements (`dp(1,2)`, `dp(2,2)`, `dp(3,2)`).
- **Second level (`dp(1,2)`, `dp(2,2)`...):** Here we try placing the second mailbox. For each placement, the function will recursively call for placing the remaining mailboxes.
- **Third level (`dp(2,1)`, `dp(3,1)`...):** This level involves placing the final mailbox, exploring possible placements for the last section of houses.

### Memoization:
To avoid recalculating results, whenever a recursive call such as `dp(2, 2)` or `dp(1, 2)` is encountered again, the memoized result is used directly. This significantly reduces redundant work and prunes the recursion tree.

### Visualization Through Levels:

1. **Level 1** (`dp(0, 3)`): Explore placing the first mailbox between all possible subarrays starting from house `0`.
2. **Level 2** (`dp(1, 2)`, `dp(2, 2)`, etc.): For each placement in Level 1, explore placing the second mailbox for the rest of the houses.
3. **Level 3** (`dp(2, 1)`, `dp(3, 1)`): For each placement in Level 2, explore placing the final mailbox.

### Simplified Trace Example:
For a smaller input like `houses = [1, 4, 8]` and `k = 2`:
- **dp(0, 2):** Place the first mailbox optimally between `houses[0]` to `houses[2]`. Possible placements:
    - `dp(1, 1)` (second mailbox for the rest of the houses).
- **dp(1, 1):** Place the second mailbox optimally between `houses[1]` and `houses[2]`.

Thus, for each level of the recursion, we minimize the total distance by placing mailboxes at optimal positions.

### Illustration Summary:
The recursive `dp(i, k)` function can be visualized as a **tree**:
- Each node represents placing a mailbox for a subarray.
- The children of each node represent the recursive calls for placing the remaining mailboxes.
- The recursion is pruned by memoizing the results of subproblems, making the process efficient.
# solution

To solve LeetCode 1478 ("Allocate Mailboxes") using a recursive approach, we can utilize a **top-down dynamic programming (DP)** approach with **memoization**. The core idea is to break the problem into smaller subproblems by recursively calculating the minimum distance for placing `k` mailboxes.

### Steps:
1. **Recursive Function Definition**:
    - Define a recursive function `minDistance(i, k)` where `i` represents the index of the current house, and `k` represents the number of mailboxes remaining to be placed.

2. **Base Case**:
    - If `k == 0` and there are no more houses to allocate, return `0` (i.e., no cost for no houses).
    - If `k == 0` but there are houses left to allocate, return infinity because it's not possible to place `0` mailboxes for remaining houses.
    - If there are houses but no mailboxes left (`i == houses.length`), return infinity.

3. **Recursive Formula**:
    - For each recursive call, we try placing a mailbox in a subarray of houses (`houses[i]` to `houses[j]`) and calculate the minimum cost for the remaining houses (`houses[j + 1]` onwards). The optimal placement is at the **median** house of the subarray.

4. **Memoization**:
    - Memoize the results of subproblems to avoid recalculating the same results.

### Recursive Approach:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class AllocateMailboxesRecursive {
    private int[][] cost;  // Precomputed cost for placing a mailbox between houses[i] and houses[j]
    private int[][] memo;  // Memoization table

    public int minDistance(int[] houses, int k) {
        int n = houses.length;
        Arrays.sort(houses);  // Sort the houses' positions to handle subarrays easily

        // Precompute the cost of placing a mailbox between houses[i] to houses[j]
        cost = new int[n][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                int median = houses[(i + j) / 2];  // Optimal place for a mailbox is at the median
                for (int p = i; p <= j; p++) {
                    cost[i][j] += Math.abs(houses[p] - median);
                }
            }
        }

        // Memoization table to store results for dp[i][k] where i is house index and k is mailboxes left
        memo = new int[n][k + 1];
        for (int[] row : memo) {
            Arrays.fill(row, -1);
        }

        // Start recursion from the first house with k mailboxes
        return dp(houses, 0, k);
    }

    // Recursive function to calculate the minimum cost
    private int dp(int[] houses, int i, int k) {
        if (k == 0 && i == houses.length) return 0;  // If no houses left and no mailboxes to place
        if (k == 0 || i == houses.length) return Integer.MAX_VALUE;  // If no more mailboxes or houses left but not both
        if (memo[i][k] != -1) return memo[i][k];  // Return memoized result if available

        int minCost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        // Try placing a mailbox between houses[i] to houses[j] and recurse for the remaining houses
        for (int j = i; j < houses.length; j++) {
            int currentCost = cost[i][j] + dp(houses, j + 1, k - 1);
            minCost = Math.min(minCost, currentCost);
        }

        memo[i][k] = minCost;  // Memoize the result
        return minCost;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AllocateMailboxesRecursive solution = new AllocateMailboxesRecursive();

        int[] houses = {1, 4, 8, 10, 20};
        int k = 3;

        System.out.println(solution.minDistance(houses, k));  // Output: 5
    }
}
```

### Key Components:
1. **Precomputing the `cost` array**:
    - `cost[i][j]`: The cost of placing one mailbox between `houses[i]` to `houses[j]`. The optimal position is at the median of the subarray.

2. **Recursive Function (`dp`)**:
    - `dp(i, k)`: Represents the minimum cost of placing `k` mailboxes starting from house index `i`.

3. **Base Cases**:
    - If there are no mailboxes left (`k == 0`) and no houses left (`i == houses.length`), the cost is `0`.
    - If `k == 0` but there are still houses left, it's an invalid situation, so return `Integer.MAX_VALUE` (infinity).
    - If `i == houses.length` but `k > 0`, it’s impossible to place mailboxes for remaining houses, so return `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

4. **Recursion**:
    - For each house `i`, we consider placing a mailbox between `houses[i]` to `houses[j]` and then recurse for the remaining houses (`houses[j+1]` onwards) with `k-1` mailboxes.

5. **Memoization**:
    - Memoize the results of `dp(i, k)` to avoid recomputing the same subproblems.

### Time Complexity:
- **Precomputing Costs (`cost[i][j]`):**
    - This step takes `O(n^2)` because for every pair of houses `i` and `j`, we compute the cost by iterating over the subarray from `i` to `j`.

- **Recursive Function:**
    - The function `dp(i, k)` has a time complexity of `O(n * k)` because we are computing the result for each combination of house index `i` and remaining mailboxes `k`. For each call, we loop through the houses (`j` from `i` to `n`), making it `O(n)` for each call.

Hence, the overall time complexity is:

\[
O(n^2 + n^2 \cdot k) = O(n^2 \cdot k)
\]

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is dominated by the `cost` and `memo` arrays, both of which are `O(n^2)`. Thus, the overall space complexity is `O(n^2 + n \cdot k)`.

### Example Walkthrough:
For `houses = [1, 4, 8, 10, 20]` and `k = 3`:
1. The recursive function tries to place the first mailbox optimally for a subarray (say, houses 0 to 1), then recurses to find the best placement of the remaining 2 mailboxes.
2. The `cost` matrix helps in calculating the minimal cost for each subarray efficiently.
