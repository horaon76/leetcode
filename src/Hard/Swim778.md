**LeetCode Problem 778: Swim in Rising Water** is an interesting problem that can be solved using a pathfinding algorithm. The goal is to determine the minimum time it takes to swim from the top-left corner of a grid to the bottom-right corner, considering that the water level rises over time.

### Problem Description

You are given an `n x n` grid `heights` where `heights[i][j]` represents the height of the water at that cell. The water level rises over time, and you can only swim in water levels that are less than or equal to the current time. You need to find the minimum time `t` required to swim from `(0, 0)` to `(n-1, n-1)`.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a **priority queue** (min-heap) to implement **Dijkstra's algorithm**. The basic idea is to explore the cells in order of their height, ensuring that we can only swim through cells where the height is less than or equal to the current water level (time).

### Steps

1. **Initialize a priority queue** that will help in exploring the cells based on their heights.
2. **Use a set** or boolean array to keep track of visited cells to prevent reprocessing.
3. **Start from the top-left corner** `(0, 0)` and add it to the priority queue.
4. **Iteratively process the cells**:
   - For each cell, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right).
   - If the neighbor cell is within bounds and not visited, add it to the priority queue.
5. The moment you reach the bottom-right corner `(n-1, n-1)`, the height at that cell represents the minimum time needed to reach it.

### Code Implementation

Here's how you can implement this in Java:

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class SwimInRisingWater {
    public int swimInWater(int[][] heights) {
        int n = heights.length;
        // Directions for moving in 4 possible ways
        int[][] directions = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};

        // Priority queue to store cells based on their height
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        pq.offer(new int[]{heights[0][0], 0, 0}); // Add the starting cell

        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[n][n]; // To track visited cells
        visited[0][0] = true; // Mark the starting cell as visited

        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = pq.poll();
            int height = current[0]; // The current water level
            int x = current[1]; // Current row
            int y = current[2]; // Current column

            // If we've reached the bottom-right corner
            if (x == n - 1 && y == n - 1) {
                return height; // This height is the minimum time needed to reach the destination
            }

            // Explore the neighbors
            for (int[] dir : directions) {
                int newX = x + dir[0];
                int newY = y + dir[1];

                // Check bounds and whether the cell has been visited
                if (newX >= 0 && newX < n && newY >= 0 && newY < n && !visited[newX][newY]) {
                    visited[newX][newY] = true; // Mark as visited
                    pq.offer(new int[]{heights[newX][newY], newX, newY}); // Add the neighbor to the queue
                }
            }
        }

        return -1; // If we somehow don't find a path, return -1 (should not happen in this problem)
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SwimInRisingWater srw = new SwimInRisingWater();
        int[][] heights1 = {
            {0, 2},
            {1, 3}
        };
        System.out.println(srw.swimInWater(heights1)); // Output: 3

        int[][] heights2 = {
            {0, 1, 2, 3, 4},
            {24, 23, 22, 21, 5},
            {12, 13, 17, 20, 6},
            {11, 16, 19, 18, 7},
            {10, 9, 8, 7, 6}
        };
        System.out.println(srw.swimInWater(heights2)); // Output: 16
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Data Structures**:
   - A **priority queue** is used to keep track of the cells to be processed based on their height.
   - A **visited array** keeps track of the cells we've already processed to avoid cycles.

2. **Processing**:
   - For each cell, we check its neighbors and add unvisited neighbors to the priority queue.
   - The cell with the lowest height is always processed first, ensuring that we can find the minimum time required to swim to the destination.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop continues until the priority queue is empty or we reach the bottom-right corner.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2 log N) where N is the number of cells in the grid. The log N factor comes from the priority queue operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N^2) for the visited array and the priority queue.

### Conclusion

This approach effectively finds the minimum time required to swim from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid while accounting for the rising water levels. If you have any questions or need further clarifications, feel free to ask!
