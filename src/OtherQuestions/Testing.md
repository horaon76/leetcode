Testing patterns are strategies or methodologies used in software testing to ensure the quality, performance, and functionality of applications. Here are some common testing patterns:

### 1. Unit Testing
- **Definition**: Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of a program in isolation to ensure they perform as expected.
- **Purpose**: To validate that each unit of the software code performs as intended.
- **Tools**: JUnit, TestNG (for Java), pytest (for Python), Mocha (for JavaScript).
- **Example**: Testing a function that calculates the sum of two numbers.

### 2. Integration Testing
- **Definition**: This type of testing focuses on the interaction between integrated units or components to identify issues in their collaboration.
- **Purpose**: To ensure that combined components function correctly together.
- **Tools**: JUnit (with Spring), Postman, Mockito (for mocking).
- **Example**: Testing how a web service interacts with a database.

### 3. Functional Testing
- **Definition**: Functional testing evaluates the system against the functional requirements/specifications.
- **Purpose**: To verify that the software behaves according to specified requirements.
- **Tools**: Selenium, QTP, Cucumber.
- **Example**: Testing user login functionality against specified requirements.

### 4. End-to-End Testing
- **Definition**: This type of testing assesses the complete flow of an application from start to finish, ensuring all components work together.
- **Purpose**: To simulate user scenarios and validate the entire application flow.
- **Tools**: Cypress, Selenium, TestCafe.
- **Example**: Testing the entire user journey of a shopping cart from adding items to completing a purchase.

### 5. Regression Testing
- **Definition**: Regression testing involves re-running previously completed tests to ensure that recent changes have not introduced new faults.
- **Purpose**: To confirm that new code changes do not adversely affect existing functionality.
- **Tools**: Selenium, JUnit, TestNG.
- **Example**: Running a suite of tests after a new feature is added to ensure previous functionality remains intact.

### 6. Performance Testing
- **Definition**: Performance testing evaluates how a system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload.
- **Purpose**: To identify bottlenecks and ensure the application can handle expected user load.
- **Tools**: JMeter, LoadRunner, Gatling.
- **Example**: Testing how many concurrent users a web application can support before slowing down.

### 7. Load Testing
- **Definition**: Load testing is a subset of performance testing that simulates the expected load on the system to determine its behavior under normal and peak conditions.
- **Purpose**: To validate the system's performance when subjected to heavy loads.
- **Tools**: Apache JMeter, LoadRunner.
- **Example**: Testing a website with 10,000 users accessing it simultaneously.

### 8. Stress Testing
- **Definition**: Stress testing evaluates how a system behaves under extreme conditions, beyond its specified limits.
- **Purpose**: To determine the breaking point of the system and how it recovers from failure.
- **Tools**: Apache JMeter, LoadRunner.
- **Example**: Testing a web application with 100,000 concurrent users.

### 9. Security Testing
- **Definition**: Security testing assesses the security features of the software and identifies vulnerabilities.
- **Purpose**: To ensure the application is protected against threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.
- **Example**: Testing for SQL injection vulnerabilities in a web application.

### 10. Contract Testing
- **Definition**: Contract testing verifies that the interactions between services comply with defined contracts, ensuring compatibility.
- **Purpose**: To ensure that service providers and consumers can work together without issues.
- **Tools**: Pact, Spring Cloud Contract.
- **Example**: Testing the interaction between a microservice that provides user data and a client that consumes that data.

### 11. Automation Testing
- **Definition**: Automation testing uses scripts and tools to automatically execute tests and compare the actual outcomes with expected outcomes.
- **Purpose**: To improve testing efficiency, coverage, and speed by automating repetitive tasks.
- **Tools**: Selenium, TestNG, Cucumber, Appium.
- **Example**: Automating the testing of a user registration form.
