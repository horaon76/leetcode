The CAP theorem states that a distributed data store can only provide two of the following three guarantees at any given time: **Consistency (C)**, **Availability (A)**, and **Partition Tolerance (P)**. Here's how these three properties are represented in a triangle, along with examples of databases that support each configuration.

### CAP Theorem Triangle

```
      Consistency (C)
            /\
           /  \
          /    \
         /      \
        /        \
       /          \
      /            \
     /              \
   Partition        Availability
   Tolerance (P)        (A)
```

### Database Examples Supporting CAP

#### 1. **CP (Consistency and Partition Tolerance)**

- **Examples**:
    - **MongoDB** (with appropriate configurations)
    - **HBase**
    - **PostgreSQL** (with synchronous replication)

- **Description**:
    - These databases prioritize consistency over availability during a network partition. In the event of a partition, they may become unavailable to maintain consistency across the data nodes. They are suitable for applications where strong consistency is critical, such as financial systems.

#### 2. **AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance)**

- **Examples**:
    - **Cassandra**
    - **DynamoDB**
    - **Riak**

- **Description**:
    - These databases focus on being available even during network partitions. They allow for eventual consistency, meaning that while some nodes might not have the most recent data immediately, the system will converge to a consistent state over time. This is suitable for applications where availability is crucial, such as social media platforms.

#### 3. **CA (Consistency and Availability)**

- **Examples**:
    - **Single-node databases** like **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL** (in a non-distributed setup)
    - **SQLite**

- **Description**:
    - These databases provide both consistency and availability, but they cannot tolerate partitions since they are typically deployed on a single node. If a network partition occurs, the system will fail. This is suitable for applications that do not require distributed data storage.

### Summary

Here's a concise table summarizing the CAP theorem configurations along with the corresponding database examples:

| Configuration | Characteristics                                 | Database Examples            |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| CP            | Consistent during partitioning, may be unavailable | MongoDB, HBase, PostgreSQL   |
| AP            | Available during partitioning, eventual consistency | Cassandra, DynamoDB, Riak    |
| CA            | Consistent and available, no partition tolerance   | MySQL, PostgreSQL (single-node), SQLite |

### Conclusion

Understanding the CAP theorem and the associated database properties helps in making informed decisions when designing distributed systems. The selection of a database should align with the specific requirements of the application, such as the need for consistency, availability, and tolerance to network partitions.
