/**
 * You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
 * <p>
 * The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.
 * <p>
 * Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
 * Output: 0
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * m == grid.length
 * n == grid[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 50
 * grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

/**
 * Let‚Äôs break it down step-by-step to clarify how the time complexity of the recursive DFS approach for the "Max Area of Island" problem is
 * ùëÇ
 * (
 * ùëõ
 * √ó
 * ùëö
 * )
 * O(n√óm):
 * <p>
 * 1. Understanding the Problem
 * You have a grid of size
 * ùëõ
 * √ó
 * ùëö
 * n√óm, where each cell can be:
 * <p>
 * Land (represented by 1)
 * Water (represented by 0)
 * The task is to find the maximum area of connected land cells (islands).
 * <p>
 * 2. Outer Loop: Iterating Through the Grid
 * The function maxAreaOfIsland includes a nested loop that iterates through each cell in the grid:
 * <p>
 * java
 * Copy code
 * for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {          // Loop through rows (n)
 * for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {   // Loop through columns (m)
 * if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
 * // Initiate DFS if we find land
 * }
 * }
 * }
 * Total Iterations: This means you are examining every single cell in the grid, leading to
 * ùëõ
 * √ó
 * ùëö
 * n√óm total iterations.
 * 3. Inside the DFS Call
 * When you find a land cell (1), you call the dfs function:
 * <p>
 * java
 * Copy code
 * private int dfs(int[][] grid, int i, int j) {
 * // Base cases and visit logic
 * // Call dfs recursively on adjacent cells
 * }
 * 4. How DFS Works
 * Visiting Cells: The DFS function will explore all connected land cells. Here‚Äôs what happens:
 * When you call DFS on a cell, it checks its 4 adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
 * If an adjacent cell is also land (1), it calls DFS on that cell too.
 * 5. Key Point: Each Cell is Processed Once
 * Here‚Äôs the crucial part of the explanation:
 * <p>
 * Marking Visited: Each time a cell is processed in the DFS, you mark it as visited by changing its value to 0 (or some other value indicating it‚Äôs no longer land).
 * java
 * Copy code
 * grid[i][j] = 0; // Mark the cell as visited
 * No Re-Processing: Because you mark each land cell as visited when you first encounter it, that cell cannot be revisited by any future DFS calls. This means:
 * Each land cell is visited exactly once during the entire run of the algorithm.
 * 6. Total Operations
 * Cells Processed: In the worst-case scenario (when the entire grid is land), you will call DFS on each of the
 * ùëõ
 * √ó
 * ùëö
 * n√óm cells exactly once.
 * Area Calculation: Inside the DFS, while calculating the area, you‚Äôre doing a constant amount of work for each land cell (checking neighbors and marking it).
 * Summary
 * Total Cells: The entire grid has
 * ùëõ
 * √ó
 * ùëö
 * n√óm cells.
 * DFS Calls: Each land cell (1) is visited exactly once, leading to a total of
 * ùëõ
 * √ó
 * ùëö
 * n√óm visits in the worst case.
 * Overall Complexity: Since the outer loop goes through every cell, and the DFS processes each cell once, the total time complexity for the algorithm is
 * ùëÇ
 * (
 * ùëõ
 * √ó
 * ùëö
 * )
 * O(n√óm).
 * Visualization
 * To visualize:
 * <p>
 * Suppose you have a grid of size
 * 3
 * √ó
 * 4
 * 3√ó4:
 * Copy code
 * 1 1 0 0
 * 1 0 0 1
 * 0 0 1 1
 * In the outer loop, you iterate through all
 * 12
 * 12 cells:
 * <p>
 * When you reach the first 1, you initiate DFS.
 * The DFS explores all connected 1s, marking them 0.
 * All other cells are either 0 or have been marked 0, so they are skipped in future iterations.
 * In total, you process all
 * 12
 * 12 cells just once, confirming the
 * ùëÇ
 * (
 * ùëõ
 * √ó
 * ùëö
 * )
 * O(n√óm) complexity.
