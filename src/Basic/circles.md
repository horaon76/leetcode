Here is a comprehensive list of important formulas related to **circles**, covering areas such as equations, areas, arc lengths, sector areas, and more:

### 1. **Equation of a Circle**

- **Standard Form (Center at \((h, k)\)):**
  \[
  (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
  \]
  Where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle, and `r` is the radius.

- **General Form:**
  \[
  x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0
  \]
  Where `D`, `E`, and `F` are constants. You can convert this into the standard form by completing the square.

### 2. **Radius of a Circle**
- In the general form \(x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0\), the radius `r` of the circle is:
  \[
  r = \sqrt{\left(\frac{-D}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{-E}{2}\right)^2 - F}
  \]

### 3. **Diameter of a Circle**
- The diameter `d` is twice the radius:
  \[
  d = 2r
  \]

### 4. **Circumference of a Circle**
- The circumference `C` is the distance around the circle:
  \[
  C = 2\pi r
  \]
  Or, using the diameter:
  \[
  C = \pi d
  \]

### 5. **Area of a Circle**
- The area `A` of a circle is given by:
  \[
  A = \pi r^2
  \]

### 6. **Arc Length**
- The length of an arc (part of the circumference) subtended by a central angle \(\theta\) (in radians):
  \[
  L = r \theta
  \]
- If \(\theta\) is in degrees, the arc length is:
  \[
  L = \frac{\pi r \theta}{180}
  \]

### 7. **Area of a Sector**
- The area of a sector (the region enclosed by two radii and an arc) subtended by a central angle \(\theta\) (in radians):
  \[
  A_{\text{sector}} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta
  \]
- If \(\theta\) is in degrees:
  \[
  A_{\text{sector}} = \frac{\pi r^2 \theta}{360}
  \]

### 8. **Length of a Chord**
- The length of a chord (a line segment joining two points on a circle) subtended by a central angle \(\theta\) (in radians):
  \[
  L_{\text{chord}} = 2r \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
  \]

### 9. **Area of a Segment**
- The area of a segment (the region enclosed by a chord and the arc) is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangular region formed by the radii and the chord.
  \[
  A_{\text{segment}} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 (\theta - \sin \theta)
  \]
- Here, \(\theta\) is in radians.

### 10. **Equation of a Tangent to a Circle**
- The equation of a tangent to a circle with center \((h, k)\) and radius `r`, at a point \((x_1, y_1)\) on the circle, is:
  \[
  (x - h)(x_1 - h) + (y - k)(y_1 - k) = r^2
  \]
- If the circle is centered at the origin \((0, 0)\), the equation of the tangent at \((x_1, y_1)\) is:
  \[
  x x_1 + y y_1 = r^2
  \]

### 11. **Power of a Point (Relative to a Circle)**
- The **power** of a point \((x_1, y_1)\) relative to a circle \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\) is:
  \[
  P = (x_1 - h)^2 + (y_1 - k)^2 - r^2
  \]
- If the point lies outside the circle, the power is positive. If it lies inside, the power is negative. If the point lies on the circle, the power is zero.

### 12. **Length of a Tangent from a Point**
- The length `L` of the tangent drawn from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a circle \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\) is:
  \[
  L = \sqrt{(x_1 - h)^2 + (y_1 - k)^2 - r^2}
  \]

### 13. **Concentric Circles**
- Two circles are said to be concentric if they share the same center but have different radii. The equations of two concentric circles with center \((h, k)\) and radii \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) are:
  \[
  (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r_1^2 \quad \text{and} \quad (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r_2^2
  \]

### 14. **Radical Axis of Two Circles**
- The radical axis is the locus of points from which tangents drawn to two given circles are equal in length. For two circles:
  \[
  (x - h_1)^2 + (y - k_1)^2 = r_1^2 \quad \text{and} \quad (x - h_2)^2 + (y - k_2)^2 = r_2^2
  \]
  The equation of the radical axis is:
  \[
  (h_1 - h_2)x + (k_1 - k_2)y + \frac{r_2^2 - r_1^2 + h_1^2 - h_2^2 + k_1^2 - k_2^2}{2} = 0
  \]

### 15. **Intersection of Two Circles**
- Two circles intersect when the distance between their centers is less than the sum of their radii but greater than the absolute difference of their radii. For two circles:
  \[
  (x - h_1)^2 + (y - k_1)^2 = r_1^2 \quad \text{and} \quad (x - h_2)^2 + (y - k_2)^2 = r_2^2
  \]
  The condition for the circles to intersect is:
  \[
  |r_1 - r_2| < \text{distance between centers} < r_1 + r_2
  \]

These formulas cover various important aspects of circles and are widely used in geometry, coordinate geometry, and trigonometry.
