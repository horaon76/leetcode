Certainly! Here’s a comprehensive overview of various types of trees, common operations on trees, their time complexities, and some relevant formulas associated with trees.

### 1. Binary Tree
A **Binary Tree** is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

#### Operations:
- **Insertion**: O(log n) on average for balanced trees; O(n) in the worst case (unbalanced).
- **Deletion**: O(log n) on average; O(n) in the worst case.
- **Traversal**:
    - Inorder: O(n)
    - Preorder: O(n)
    - Postorder: O(n)

### 2. Binary Search Tree (BST)
A **Binary Search Tree** is a binary tree with the property that for each node, all values in the left subtree are less than the node’s value, and all values in the right subtree are greater.

#### Operations:
- **Insertion**: O(log n) on average; O(n) in the worst case (unbalanced).
- **Deletion**: O(log n) on average; O(n) in the worst case.
- **Search**: O(log n) on average; O(n) in the worst case.

### 3. AVL Tree
An **AVL Tree** is a self-balancing binary search tree where the height difference between left and right subtrees is at most one.

#### Operations:
- **Insertion**: O(log n)
- **Deletion**: O(log n)
- **Search**: O(log n)

### 4. Red-Black Tree
A **Red-Black Tree** is another self-balancing binary search tree with specific properties (like color properties) that maintain balance during insertions and deletions.

#### Operations:
- **Insertion**: O(log n)
- **Deletion**: O(log n)
- **Search**: O(log n)

### 5. B-tree
A **B-tree** is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. B-trees are optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data.

#### Operations:
- **Insertion**: O(log n)
- **Deletion**: O(log n)
- **Search**: O(log n)

### 6. Trie
A **Trie** (or prefix tree) is a tree used to store a dynamic set of strings, where the keys are usually strings. Each node represents a character of the string.

#### Operations:
- **Insertion**: O(m) where m is the length of the key.
- **Search**: O(m)
- **Deletion**: O(m)

### 7. Segment Tree
A **Segment Tree** is a binary tree used for storing intervals or segments. It allows querying which segments overlap with a given point or segment.

#### Operations:
- **Construction**: O(n)
- **Query**: O(log n)
- **Update**: O(log n)

### 8. Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
A **Fenwick Tree** (or Binary Indexed Tree) is a data structure that provides efficient methods for cumulative frequency tables.

#### Operations:
- **Update**: O(log n)
- **Query**: O(log n)

### Common Formulas Associated with Trees

1. **Height of a Binary Tree**:
    - For a complete binary tree with \( n \) nodes, the height \( h \) is given by:
      \[
      h = \lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor
      \]

2. **Maximum Nodes in a Binary Tree**:
    - The maximum number of nodes \( n \) in a binary tree of height \( h \) is:
      \[
      n = 2^{h+1} - 1
      \]

3. **Minimum Height of a Binary Search Tree**:
    - For \( n \) nodes, the minimum height \( h \) of a balanced binary search tree is:
      \[
      h = \lceil \log_2(n + 1) \rceil
      \]

4. **Time Complexity of Traversals**:
    - For all tree traversal methods (inorder, preorder, postorder), the time complexity is \( O(n) \).

5. **Sum of the Depths of Nodes**:
    - If \( d \) is the depth of a node, the sum of the depths of all nodes in a binary tree with \( n \) nodes can be given by:
      \[
      \text{Sum of depths} = n \times h
      \]

6. **Node Count at Level \( l \)**:
    - The maximum number of nodes at level \( l \) in a binary tree is \( 2^l \).

| Red-Black Tree        | O(log n)  | O(log n) | O(log n)|
| B-tree                | O(log n)  | O(log n) | O(log n)|
| Trie                  | O(m)      | O(m)     | O(m)    |
| Segment Tree          | O(n)      | O(log n) | O(log n)|
| Fenwick Tree          | O(log n)  | O(log n) | O(log n)|
