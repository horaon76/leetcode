Here are all the key formulas related to lines, covering concepts like slopes, equations, distances, angles, and more:

### 1. **Slope of a Line**
- The **slope** (denoted as `m`) is the rate of change of `y` with respect to `x`.
- **Formula:**  
  \[
  m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
  \]
- Where \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) are two points on the line.

### 2. **Equation of a Line**

- **Point-Slope Form:**  
  If you know the slope and a point \((x_1, y_1)\) on the line:
  \[
  y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
  \]

- **Slope-Intercept Form:**  
  When the slope (`m`) and the y-intercept (`b`) are known:
  \[
  y = mx + b
  \]
  Where `b` is the value where the line intersects the y-axis (i.e., when `x = 0`).

- **Standard Form (Ax + By = C):**
  This is a general form of a line equation:
  \[
  Ax + By = C
  \]
  Where `A`, `B`, and `C` are constants.

- **Two-Point Form:**  
  If two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) on the line are known:
  \[
  y - y_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1)
  \]

### 3. **Vertical and Horizontal Lines**

- **Vertical Line (undefined slope):**  
  A line that is vertical has no slope, and the equation is:
  \[
  x = a
  \]
  Where `a` is the constant x-coordinate for every point on the line.

- **Horizontal Line (zero slope):**  
  A line that is horizontal has a slope of 0, and the equation is:
  \[
  y = b
  \]
  Where `b` is the constant y-coordinate for every point on the line.

### 4. **Distance Between Two Points**
- The distance `d` between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\):
  \[
  d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
  \]

### 5. **Distance from a Point to a Line**
- The distance `d` from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\):
  \[
  d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
  \]

### 6. **Midpoint of a Line Segment**
- The midpoint \(M\) of a line segment joining \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\):
  \[
  M = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
  \]

### 7. **Angle Between Two Lines**
- If two lines have slopes \(m_1\) and \(m_2\), the angle \(\theta\) between them is:
  \[
  \tan(\theta) = \frac{|m_1 - m_2|}{1 + m_1 m_2}
  \]
- If the product \(m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1\), the lines are **perpendicular**.

### 8. **Parallel and Perpendicular Lines**

- **Parallel Lines:**
    - Two lines are parallel if their slopes are equal:  
      \[
      m_1 = m_2
      \]

- **Perpendicular Lines:**
    - Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is \(-1\):  
      \[
      m_1 \cdot m_2 = -1
      \]

### 9. **Collinearity of Three Points**
- Three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) are collinear (lie on the same line) if the area of the triangle formed by them is zero.
- **Area of Triangle Formula:**
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
  \]
- If the area is zero, the points are collinear.

### 10. **General Equation of a Line in 3D**
- In 3D space, the equation of a line passing through a point \((x_1, y_1, z_1)\) and having direction ratios \((a, b, c)\) can be expressed as:
  \[
  \frac{x - x_1}{a} = \frac{y - y_1}{b} = \frac{z - z_1}{c}
  \]

These are the most important formulas related to lines in geometry, coordinate geometry, and algebra.
