Dynamic Programming (DP) problems often involve breaking down complex problems into simpler subproblems, which are solved once and stored for future use. The dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D) represent how many states or variables are being tracked in the subproblems. Let's break it down with explanations and examples for each type.

### 1. **1D DP**
**Problem Type**: Solving problems where the solution depends on a single variable or dimension (e.g., length of an array, or index).

**Example**: **Fibonacci Sequence**
- In this problem, each Fibonacci number depends on the previous two numbers.
- We can store the Fibonacci values in a 1D array to avoid recalculating them.

**Java Example**:
   ```java
   public class Fibonacci {
       public int fibonacci(int n) {
           if (n <= 1) {
               return n;
           }
           int[] dp = new int[n + 1]; // 1D DP array
           dp[0] = 0;
           dp[1] = 1;

           for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
               dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]; // Current value depends on the last two values
           }
           return dp[n];
       }

       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Fibonacci fib = new Fibonacci();
           System.out.println(fib.fibonacci(10)); // Output: 55
       }
   }
   ```
**Explanation**: Here, the DP array `dp` stores the Fibonacci numbers up to `n`, and each state `dp[i]` depends on the previous two states (`dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`).

### 2. **2D DP**
**Problem Type**: These are problems where the solution depends on two variables, often represented by a grid or matrix (e.g., row and column).

**Example**: **Edit Distance Problem**
- You are given two strings, and you need to find the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, or replacements) to convert one string into another.
- This can be solved by using a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` stores the edit distance for the first `i` characters of the first string and the first `j` characters of the second string.

**Java Example**:
   ```java
   public class EditDistance {
       public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
           int m = word1.length();
           int n = word2.length();
           int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1]; // 2D DP array

           // Initialize the first row and first column
           for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
               dp[i][0] = i;
           }
           for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
               dp[0][j] = j;
           }

           for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
               for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                   if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                       dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]; // If characters match, no change
                   } else {
                       dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], // Replace
                                Math.min(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j])) + 1; // Insert or Delete
                   }
               }
           }
           return dp[m][n];
       }

       public static void main(String[] args) {
           EditDistance ed = new EditDistance();
           System.out.println(ed.minDistance("horse", "ros")); // Output: 3
       }
   }
   ```
**Explanation**: We use a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` stores the edit distance between substrings of `word1` and `word2`. The solution considers three operations (insert, delete, and replace), and builds up the result by comparing characters in both strings.

### 3. **3D DP**
**Problem Type**: These problems involve tracking three variables. These types of problems are rarer but arise in more complex scenarios like multi-dimensional pathfinding or when there are multiple states to track (e.g., time, resource, and position).

**Example**: **Knapsack Problem with Multiple Constraints**
- Suppose you have items with weights and values, and you want to maximize the value you can carry, but you also have an additional constraint like time or energy, which means you have to track more than just weight and value.
- You would need a 3D DP table where `dp[i][j][k]` represents the maximum value for the first `i` items, weight `j`, and some third constraint `k`.

**Java Example**:
   ```java
   public class Knapsack3D {
       public int knapsackWithConstraint(int[] weights, int[] values, int maxWeight, int[] times, int maxTime) {
           int n = weights.length;
           int[][][] dp = new int[n + 1][maxWeight + 1][maxTime + 1]; // 3D DP array

           for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
               for (int w = 0; w <= maxWeight; w++) {
                   for (int t = 0; t <= maxTime; t++) {
                       dp[i][w][t] = dp[i - 1][w][t]; // If we don't take the item
                       if (w >= weights[i - 1] && t >= times[i - 1]) {
                           dp[i][w][t] = Math.max(dp[i][w][t], 
                               dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]][t - times[i - 1]] + values[i - 1]);
                       }
                   }
               }
           }
           return dp[n][maxWeight][maxTime];
       }

       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Knapsack3D ks = new Knapsack3D();
           int[] weights = {2, 3, 4};
           int[] values = {3, 4, 5};
           int[] times = {1, 2, 3};
           System.out.println(ks.knapsackWithConstraint(weights, values, 5, times, 3)); // Output: 7
       }
   }
   ```
**Explanation**: The DP state `dp[i][w][t]` tracks the maximum value using the first `i` items, with a weight limit `w` and a time limit `t`. The solution either takes or skips each item based on weight and time constraints.

### Summary of Approach:
- **1D DP**: Used when only one state or dimension matters (e.g., array index).
- **2D DP**: Used when two states need to be tracked (e.g., two strings, two dimensions in a matrix).
- **3D DP**: Used when three states are involved (e.g., weight, value, and additional constraints).

In all cases, the key is breaking the problem into subproblems and using the DP table to store previously computed results.
