Andrew's monotone chain algorithm is an efficient method for computing the **convex hull** of a set of 2D points. This algorithm operates in **\(O(n \log n)\)** time complexity, primarily due to the sorting step, and is notable for its simplicity and effectiveness.

### Overview of Convex Hull

The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon that encloses all the points. Imagine stretching a rubber band around the outermost points; when released, it will form the convex hull.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Sort the Points**:
    - Start by sorting the points lexicographically, first by the x-coordinate and then by the y-coordinate. This helps in processing the points in a systematic order.

2. **Build the Lower Hull**:
    - Initialize an empty list for the lower hull.
    - Iterate through the sorted points, and for each point, check the orientation of the last two points in the current hull with the new point using the cross product.
    - If the last two points and the new point form a non-counter-clockwise turn (i.e., clockwise or collinear), remove the last point from the hull until the condition is satisfied.
    - Add the new point to the hull.

3. **Build the Upper Hull**:
    - Repeat the same process but iterate through the points in reverse order to construct the upper hull.

4. **Combine the Hulls**:
    - Remove the last point from both hulls, as they are the same, and concatenate the lower and upper hulls to get the final convex hull.

### Pseudocode

Hereâ€™s a high-level pseudocode representation of Andrew's monotone chain algorithm:

```plaintext
function convexHull(points):
    sort(points)  // Sort points lexicographically by x, then by y

    lower = []  // Initialize the lower hull
    for point in points:
        while size(lower) >= 2 and cross(lower[-2], lower[-1], point) <= 0:
            lower.pop()  // Remove last point from the hull
        lower.append(point)

    upper = []  // Initialize the upper hull
    for point in reversed(points):
        while size(upper) >= 2 and cross(upper[-2], upper[-1], point) <= 0:
            upper.pop()  // Remove last point from the hull
        upper.append(point)

    return lower[:-1] + upper[:-1]  // Concatenate lower and upper hulls, excluding duplicate endpoints
```

### Cross Product Function

The cross product is used to determine the orientation of the triplet of points (p, q, r):
- A positive cross product indicates a counter-clockwise turn.
- A negative cross product indicates a clockwise turn.
- A zero cross product indicates that the points are collinear.

The cross product can be computed as follows:

```plaintext
cross(p, q, r) = (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x)
```

### Example

Let's say we have the following set of points:

```
(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 0), (1, 2), (0, 2), (1, 0)
```

After sorting and applying Andrew's monotone chain algorithm, the convex hull would be:

```
(0, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), (0, 2)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Building the hull**: \(O(n)\) for both the lower and upper hull.
- **Overall**: \(O(n \log n)\)

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to storing the points in the hull.

### Implementation in Java

Here is a sample implementation of Andrew's monotone chain algorithm in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Point {
    int x, y;

    Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}

public class AndrewMonotoneChain {

    public static List<Point> convexHull(Point[] points) {
        Arrays.sort(points, (a, b) -> a.x != b.x ? Integer.compare(a.x, b.x) : Integer.compare(a.y, b.y));

        List<Point> lower = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Point p : points) {
            while (lower.size() >= 2 && cross(lower.get(lower.size() - 2), lower.get(lower.size() - 1), p) <= 0) {
                lower.remove(lower.size() - 1);
            }
            lower.add(p);
        }

        List<Point> upper = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = points.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            Point p = points[i];
            while (upper.size() >= 2 && cross(upper.get(upper.size() - 2), upper.get(upper.size() - 1), p) <= 0) {
                upper.remove(upper.size() - 1);
            }
            upper.add(p);
        }

        upper.remove(upper.size() - 1); // Remove last point as it is the same as the first point in the lower hull
        lower.addAll(upper); // Concatenate lower and upper hull

        return lower; // Return the convex hull points
    }

    private static int cross(Point o, Point a, Point b) {
        return (a.x - o.x) * (b.y - o.y) - (a.y - o.y) * (b.x - o.x);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Point[] points = {
            new Point(0, 0), new Point(1, 1), new Point(2, 2),
            new Point(2, 0), new Point(1, 2), new Point(0, 2),
            new Point(1, 0)
        };

        List<Point> hull = convexHull(points);
        System.out.println("Convex Hull Points:");
        for (Point p : hull) {
            System.out.println("(" + p.x + ", " + p.y + ")");
        }
    }
}
```
