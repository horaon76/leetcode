Permutations
Definition: A permutation is an arrangement of elements from a set in a specific order. The order of arrangement is crucial; thus, different orders of the same set of elements are considered distinct permutations.

Formula: For a set of nnn elements, the number of ways to arrange rrr elements is given by:

P(n,r)=n!(n−r)!P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}P(n,r)=(n−r)!n!​

where n!n!n! (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to nnn.

Example:
Consider the set {A,B,C}{A, B, C}{A,B,C}.
The permutations of taking 2 elements at a time are: AB,AC,BA,BC,CA,CBAB, AC, BA, BC, CA, CBAB,AC,BA,BC,CA,CB.
There are P(3,2)=3!(3−2)!=61=6P(3, 2) = \frac{3!}{(3 - 2)!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6P(3,2)=(3−2)!3!​=16​=6 permutations.
Combinations
Definition: A combination is a selection of elements from a set without regard to the order. The order does not matter, so different arrangements of the same set of elements are considered the same combination.

Formula: For a set of nnn elements, the number of ways to choose rrr elements is given by:

C(n,r)=n!r!(n−r)!C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}C(n,r)=r!(n−r)!n!​

where r!r!r! is the factorial of rrr and (n−r)!(n - r)!(n−r)! accounts for the elements not chosen.

Example:
Consider the same set {A,B,C}{A, B, C}{A,B,C}.
The combinations of taking 2 elements at a time are: AB,AC,BCAB, AC, BCAB,AC,BC.
There are C(3,2)=3!2!(3−2)!=62×1=3C(3, 2) = \frac{3!}{2! (3 - 2)!} = \frac{6}{2 \times 1} = 3C(3,2)=2!(3−2)!3!​=2×16​=3 combinations.
Key Differences
Order:

Permutations: Order matters. ABABAB is different from BABABA.
Combinations: Order does not matter. ABABAB is the same as BABABA.
Count:

The number of permutations is usually greater than the number of combinations when r>0r > 0r>0.
Formulas:

Permutations use the formula P(n,r)P(n, r)P(n,r) while combinations use C(n,r)C(n, r)C(n,r).
Visualizing with Examples
Example 1 (Permutations):

Set: {1,2,3}{1, 2, 3}{1,2,3}
Arranging 2 elements:
Permutations: (1,2),(1,3),(2,1),(2,3),(3,1),(3,2)(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)(1,2),(1,3),(2,1),(2,3),(3,1),(3,2) → Total: 6 permutations.
Example 2 (Combinations):

Set: {1,2,3}{1, 2, 3}{1,2,3}
Choosing 2 elements:
Combinations: {1,2},{1,3},{2,3}{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}{1,2},{1,3},{2,3} → Total: 3 combinations.
