Let's dive into another **Abstract Factory** example involving a **Car Manufacturing System**. In this example, we will design a system that manufactures different types of cars (e.g., **Sedan** and **SUV**) in two variants: **Electric** and **Gasoline**.

The **Abstract Factory Pattern** will help create cars based on the type and fuel variant without hardcoding the specific car classes in the client code.

### Scenario:

Imagine a car manufacturing system where we need to produce different types of cars, such as **SUV** and **Sedan**, which can either be **Electric** or **Gasoline**. The Abstract Factory Pattern will allow us to generate families of related car objects (SUVs and Sedans) in both electric and gasoline variants.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Define the Abstract Product Interfaces

We will define two abstract products: `Car` (for SUVs and Sedans) and `Engine` (for Electric or Gasoline engines). These abstract products will be implemented differently based on the type and variant.

#### Car Interface

```java
// Abstract Product - Car
public interface Car {
    void assemble();  // Method for assembling the car
}
```

#### Engine Interface

```java
// Abstract Product - Engine
public interface Engine {
    void design();  // Method for designing the engine
}
```

### Step 2: Create Concrete Products

For each abstract product (`Car` and `Engine`), we will have concrete implementations for **SUV** and **Sedan**, and each of these will have variants for **Electric** and **Gasoline** engines.

#### ElectricSUV Class:

```java
// Concrete Product - Electric SUV
public class ElectricSUV implements Car {
    @Override
    public void assemble() {
        System.out.println("Assembling an Electric SUV.");
    }
}
```

#### GasolineSUV Class:

```java
// Concrete Product - Gasoline SUV
public class GasolineSUV implements Car {
    @Override
    public void assemble() {
        System.out.println("Assembling a Gasoline SUV.");
    }
}
```

#### ElectricSedan Class:

```java
// Concrete Product - Electric Sedan
public class ElectricSedan implements Car {
    @Override
    public void assemble() {
        System.out.println("Assembling an Electric Sedan.");
    }
}
```

#### GasolineSedan Class:

```java
// Concrete Product - Gasoline Sedan
public class GasolineSedan implements Car {
    @Override
    public void assemble() {
        System.out.println("Assembling a Gasoline Sedan.");
    }
}
```

#### ElectricEngine Class:

```java
// Concrete Product - Electric Engine
public class ElectricEngine implements Engine {
    @Override
    public void design() {
        System.out.println("Designing an Electric Engine.");
    }
}
```

#### GasolineEngine Class:

```java
// Concrete Product - Gasoline Engine
public class GasolineEngine implements Engine {
    @Override
    public void design() {
        System.out.println("Designing a Gasoline Engine.");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Define the Abstract Factory Interface

The **abstract factory** will define methods to create the abstract products `Car` and `Engine`. Each concrete factory will implement this interface to produce the appropriate types of cars and engines.

```java
// Abstract Factory
public interface CarFactory {
    Car createCar();
    Engine createEngine();
}
```

### Step 4: Create Concrete Factories

We will create two concrete factories, one for producing **Electric Cars** and one for **Gasoline Cars**. Each factory will create a specific type of car (SUV or Sedan) and the appropriate engine variant (Electric or Gasoline).

#### ElectricCarFactory Class:

```java
// Concrete Factory - ElectricCarFactory
public class ElectricCarFactory implements CarFactory {
    private String carType;

    public ElectricCarFactory(String carType) {
        this.carType = carType;
    }

    @Override
    public Car createCar() {
        if ("SUV".equalsIgnoreCase(carType)) {
            return new ElectricSUV();
        } else if ("Sedan".equalsIgnoreCase(carType)) {
            return new ElectricSedan();
        }
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public Engine createEngine() {
        return new ElectricEngine();
    }
}
```

#### GasolineCarFactory Class:

```java
// Concrete Factory - GasolineCarFactory
public class GasolineCarFactory implements CarFactory {
    private String carType;

    public GasolineCarFactory(String carType) {
        this.carType = carType;
    }

    @Override
    public Car createCar() {
        if ("SUV".equalsIgnoreCase(carType)) {
            return new GasolineSUV();
        } else if ("Sedan".equalsIgnoreCase(carType)) {
            return new GasolineSedan();
        }
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public Engine createEngine() {
        return new GasolineEngine();
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Implement the Client Code

The client will use the abstract factory to get the appropriate family of products (`Car` and `Engine`), and the client does not need to know the specifics of the product creation process.

```java
// Client code
public class CarManufacturing {
    private Car car;
    private Engine engine;

    public CarManufacturing(CarFactory factory) {
        car = factory.createCar();
        engine = factory.createEngine();
    }

    public void manufactureCar() {
        car.assemble();
        engine.design();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get the car type and engine type from user input or configuration
        String carType = "SUV";       // SUV or Sedan
        String engineType = "Electric";  // Electric or Gasoline

        CarFactory factory;
        if ("Electric".equalsIgnoreCase(engineType)) {
            factory = new ElectricCarFactory(carType);
        } else {
            factory = new GasolineCarFactory(carType);
        }

        // Manufacture the car based on the factory
        CarManufacturing manufacturing = new CarManufacturing(factory);
        manufacturing.manufactureCar();  // Manufacture either an Electric or Gasoline car
    }
}
```

### Output for Electric SUV:

```
Assembling an Electric SUV.
Designing an Electric Engine.
```

### Output for Gasoline Sedan:

```
Assembling a Gasoline Sedan.
Designing a Gasoline Engine.
```

### Explanation of Abstract Factory Pattern in This Example:

1. **Abstract Factory (`CarFactory`)**:
    - The `CarFactory` interface defines methods for creating `Car` and `Engine` objects. This provides a generalized interface for car and engine creation without binding the client to specific implementations.

2. **Concrete Factories (`ElectricCarFactory` and `GasolineCarFactory`)**:
    - These concrete factories implement the `CarFactory` interface and provide specific implementations of `Car` and `Engine` for Electric and Gasoline vehicles. Each factory is responsible for producing a specific type of car with a specific engine type.

3. **Abstract Products (`Car` and `Engine`)**:
    - The abstract products define the interface for types of cars (`SUV` and `Sedan`) and types of engines (`Electric` and `Gasoline`). The client only interacts with these abstract products.

4. **Concrete Products**:
    - The concrete products (e.g., `ElectricSUV`, `GasolineSedan`, `ElectricEngine`, `GasolineEngine`) implement the abstract product interfaces to represent specific types of cars and engines.

5. **Client Code**:
    - The client code is responsible for creating the correct factory based on the user input (Electric or Gasoline) and car type (SUV or Sedan). The client is decoupled from the specific implementations of the cars and engines and only interacts with the abstract interfaces.

### Benefits of Using Abstract Factory in this Scenario:

1. **Decoupling**:
    - The client code is decoupled from the specific implementations of cars and engines, promoting loose coupling. It only interacts with the `Car` and `Engine` interfaces.

2. **Consistency Across Families**:
    - The factory ensures that related products (Electric or Gasoline cars and engines) are used together. For example, you can't accidentally combine an Electric SUV with a Gasoline engine because the factory enforces this consistency.

3. **Extensibility**:
    - If a new type of car (e.g., **Truck**) or a new engine variant (e.g., **Hybrid**) is introduced, you can easily extend the system by adding new factories and product classes without changing existing client code.

4. **Flexibility**:
    - The system is flexible because new car types or engine types can be introduced by extending the concrete factories or adding new ones without modifying the client code.

### Conclusion:

The **Abstract Factory Pattern** is useful in scenarios where you need to create families of related products, like cars and engines in this example. It ensures that products are created in a consistent and scalable manner while keeping the client code independent of the specific implementations. The abstract factory pattern makes it easy to introduce new product families (e.g., a new car type or engine variant) without affecting existing code, thereby making the system highly maintainable and extensible.
