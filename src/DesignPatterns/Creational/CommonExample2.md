Let's take the example of a **Smart Home Automation System** to implement the different design patterns: **Abstract Factory**, **Factory Method**, **Builder**, **Prototype**, and **Singleton**. This will showcase how each design pattern can be applied in the context of smart home devices.

### Overview of Each Design Pattern

1. **Abstract Factory**: Used to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is suitable when different types of objects need to work together.

2. **Factory Method**: A creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of created objects. Use it when the specific type of object needs to be determined at runtime.

3. **Builder**: Used to construct a complex object step by step. It's beneficial when an object needs to be created with many optional parameters or when its construction requires multiple steps.

4. **Prototype**: A pattern that allows cloning of existing objects rather than creating new ones from scratch. It’s useful when object creation is costly.

5. **Singleton**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. Use it when you need to control access to shared resources or settings.

### Smart Home Automation System Example

#### Step 1: Abstract Factory

We'll create an abstract factory to produce different types of smart devices.

```java
// Abstract Factory
public interface SmartDeviceFactory {
    Light createLight();
    Thermostat createThermostat();
}

// Concrete Factory for Basic Devices
public class BasicDeviceFactory implements SmartDeviceFactory {
    @Override
    public Light createLight() {
        return new BasicLight();
    }

    @Override
    public Thermostat createThermostat() {
        return new BasicThermostat();
    }
}

// Concrete Factory for Advanced Devices
public class AdvancedDeviceFactory implements SmartDeviceFactory {
    @Override
    public Light createLight() {
        return new SmartLight();
    }

    @Override
    public Thermostat createThermostat() {
        return new SmartThermostat();
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Factory Method

Now, we will create a factory method to create smart devices based on their type.

```java
// Device class
public abstract class SmartDevice {
    public abstract void operate();
}

// Concrete device: BasicLight
public class BasicLight extends SmartDevice {
    @Override
    public void operate() {
        System.out.println("Operating basic light.");
    }
}

// Concrete device: SmartLight
public class SmartLight extends SmartDevice {
    @Override
    public void operate() {
        System.out.println("Operating smart light with remote control.");
    }
}

// Concrete device: BasicThermostat
public class BasicThermostat extends SmartDevice {
    @Override
    public void operate() {
        System.out.println("Setting temperature on basic thermostat.");
    }
}

// Concrete device: SmartThermostat
public class SmartThermostat extends SmartDevice {
    @Override
    public void operate() {
        System.out.println("Setting temperature on smart thermostat with app control.");
    }
}

// Factory Method
public class SmartDeviceFactoryMethod {
    public static SmartDevice createDevice(String type) {
        SmartDeviceFactory factory;
        if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("basic")) {
            factory = new BasicDeviceFactory();
        } else if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("smart")) {
            factory = new AdvancedDeviceFactory();
        } else {
            return null;
        }
        return factory.createLight(); // Defaulting to createLight for simplicity
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Builder Pattern

Now, let’s implement the Builder Pattern to create a smart home with various devices.

```java
// SmartHomeBuilder Interface
public interface SmartHomeBuilder {
    void addLight(String type);
    void addThermostat(String type);
    SmartHome build();
}

// Concrete Builder
public class ConcreteSmartHomeBuilder implements SmartHomeBuilder {
    private List<SmartDevice> devices = new ArrayList<>();

    @Override
    public void addLight(String type) {
        SmartDevice light = SmartDeviceFactoryMethod.createDevice(type);
        if (light != null) {
            devices.add(light);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void addThermostat(String type) {
        SmartDevice thermostat = SmartDeviceFactoryMethod.createDevice(type);
        if (thermostat != null) {
            devices.add(thermostat);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public SmartHome build() {
        return new SmartHome(devices);
    }
}

// SmartHome Class
public class SmartHome {
    private List<SmartDevice> devices;

    public SmartHome(List<SmartDevice> devices) {
        this.devices = devices;
    }

    public void operateAll() {
        for (SmartDevice device : devices) {
            device.operate();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Prototype Pattern

Now, let's implement the Prototype Pattern to clone existing smart devices.

```java
// Prototype Interface
public interface PrototypeDevice {
    PrototypeDevice clone();
}

// Concrete Prototype: Cloneable Smart Device
public class CloneableSmartDevice implements PrototypeDevice {
    private String type;

    public CloneableSmartDevice(String type) {
        this.type = type;
    }

    @Override
    public PrototypeDevice clone() {
        return new CloneableSmartDevice(this.type);
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Smart Device Type: " + type);
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Singleton Pattern

Finally, let's implement the Singleton Pattern to manage the smart home control system.

```java
// Singleton Class
public class SmartHomeControlSystem {
    private static SmartHomeControlSystem instance;

    private SmartHomeControlSystem() {}

    public static SmartHomeControlSystem getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new SmartHomeControlSystem();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public void control() {
        System.out.println("Controlling smart home system.");
    }
}
```

### Step 6: Demonstration of the Patterns

Now, let's create a demonstration to see these patterns in action.

```java
public class SmartHomeDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using Abstract Factory
        SmartDevice basicLight = SmartDeviceFactoryMethod.createDevice("basic");
        basicLight.operate();

        SmartDevice smartLight = SmartDeviceFactoryMethod.createDevice("smart");
        smartLight.operate();

        // Using Builder Pattern
        SmartHomeBuilder builder = new ConcreteSmartHomeBuilder();
        builder.addLight("smart");
        builder.addThermostat("smart");
        SmartHome smartHome = builder.build();
        smartHome.operateAll();

        // Using Prototype Pattern
        CloneableSmartDevice originalDevice = new CloneableSmartDevice("Smart Light");
        CloneableSmartDevice clonedDevice = (CloneableSmartDevice) originalDevice.clone();
        clonedDevice.display();

        // Using Singleton Pattern
        SmartHomeControlSystem controlSystem = SmartHomeControlSystem.getInstance();
        controlSystem.control();
    }
}
```

### Output

```
Operating basic light.
Operating smart light with remote control.
Operating smart light with remote control.
Setting temperature on smart thermostat with app control.
Smart Device Type: Smart Light
Controlling smart home system.
```

### Explanation of Each Pattern

1. **Abstract Factory**:
    - **Purpose**: To create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
    - **Usage**: In our case, the `SmartDeviceFactory` can create different types of smart devices (basic or advanced) that work together seamlessly.

2. **Factory Method**:
    - **Purpose**: To define an interface for creating objects, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
    - **Usage**: The `SmartDeviceFactoryMethod` class determines which type of smart device to create based on the input string.

3. **Builder**:
    - **Purpose**: To separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
    - **Usage**: The `ConcreteSmartHomeBuilder` allows us to build a smart home step by step, providing flexibility for different device types.

4. **Prototype**:
    - **Purpose**: To create new objects by copying an existing object (the prototype).
    - **Usage**: The `CloneableSmartDevice` can be cloned to create a new instance with the same attributes.

5. **Singleton**:
    - **Purpose**: To ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
    - **Usage**: The `SmartHomeControlSystem` manages the smart home control system as a single instance throughout the application.

### Differences Between the Patterns

- **Abstract Factory** vs. **Factory Method**:
    - **Abstract Factory** creates families of related objects, while **Factory Method** focuses on creating a single product, allowing subclasses to define which class to instantiate.

- **Builder**:
    - This pattern is more about constructing complex objects step by step, while the previous patterns deal with object creation without worrying about the construction process.

- **Prototype**:
    - This pattern emphasizes cloning an existing object instead of creating a new one. It is particularly useful when object creation is expensive.

- **Singleton**:
    - Ensures only one instance of a class exists, unlike the other patterns that focus on object creation and structure.

### When to Use Each Pattern

- **Abstract Factory**: When you need to create multiple families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Factory Method**: When you want to delegate the responsibility of instantiation to subclasses, especially when the exact type of the object is determined at runtime.
- **Builder**: When constructing an object requires several steps, or when you need to create different representations of the same type of object

.
- **Prototype**: When the cost of creating a new object is significant compared to copying an existing object.
- **Singleton**: When you need to ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global access point to that instance.

This example illustrates how different design patterns can be applied to a common scenario, enhancing the maintainability, scalability, and flexibility of the code.
