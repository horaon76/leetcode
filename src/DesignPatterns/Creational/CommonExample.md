Sure! Let's take a common example of a **Car Manufacturing System** to implement different design patterns: **Abstract Factory**, **Factory Method**, **Builder**, **Prototype**, and **Singleton**. We will create a structure that showcases how each design pattern can be applied in the context of car manufacturing.

### Overview of Each Design Pattern

1. **Abstract Factory**: Used to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It's ideal when you need to create multiple types of objects that belong together.

2. **Factory Method**: A creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of created objects. Use it when the exact type of object needs to be determined at runtime.

3. **Builder**: Used to construct a complex object step by step. It's useful when an object needs to be created with many optional parameters, or when its construction requires multiple steps.

4. **Prototype**: A pattern that allows cloning of existing objects rather than creating new ones from scratch. It’s beneficial when object creation is costly.

5. **Singleton**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. Use it when you need to control access to shared resources or settings.

### Car Manufacturing System Example

#### Step 1: Abstract Factory

We'll create an abstract factory to produce different types of cars.

```java
// Abstract Factory
public interface CarFactory {
    Engine createEngine();
    Body createBody();
}

// Concrete Factory for Sports Cars
public class SportsCarFactory implements CarFactory {
    @Override
    public Engine createEngine() {
        return new SportsEngine();
    }

    @Override
    public Body createBody() {
        return new SportsBody();
    }
}

// Concrete Factory for SUV Cars
public class SUVCarFactory implements CarFactory {
    @Override
    public Engine createEngine() {
        return new SUVEngine();
    }

    @Override
    public Body createBody() {
        return new SUVBody();
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Factory Method

Now, we will create a factory method to create cars based on their type.

```java
// Car class
public abstract class Car {
    protected Engine engine;
    protected Body body;

    public abstract void drive();
}

// Concrete car: SportsCar
public class SportsCar extends Car {
    public SportsCar(Engine engine, Body body) {
        this.engine = engine;
        this.body = body;
    }

    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a sports car with " + engine.getType() + " engine and " + body.getType() + " body.");
    }
}

// Concrete car: SUV
public class SUV extends Car {
    public SUV(Engine engine, Body body) {
        this.engine = engine;
        this.body = body;
    }

    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving an SUV with " + engine.getType() + " engine and " + body.getType() + " body.");
    }
}

// Factory Method
public class CarFactory {
    public static Car createCar(String type) {
        CarFactory factory;
        if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("sports")) {
            factory = new SportsCarFactory();
            return new SportsCar(factory.createEngine(), factory.createBody());
        } else if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("suv")) {
            factory = new SUVCarFactory();
            return new SUV(factory.createEngine(), factory.createBody());
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Builder Pattern

Now, let’s implement the Builder Pattern to create a `Car` with various attributes.

```java
// CarBuilder Interface
public interface CarBuilder {
    void setEngine(String type);
    void setBody(String type);
    Car build();
}

// Concrete Builder
public class ConcreteCarBuilder implements CarBuilder {
    private Engine engine;
    private Body body;

    @Override
    public void setEngine(String type) {
        if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("sports")) {
            engine = new SportsEngine();
        } else {
            engine = new SUVEngine();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void setBody(String type) {
        if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("sports")) {
            body = new SportsBody();
        } else {
            body = new SUVBody();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public Car build() {
        return new SportsCar(engine, body); // Defaulting to SportsCar for simplicity
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Prototype Pattern

Now, let's implement the Prototype Pattern to clone existing cars.

```java
// Prototype Interface
public interface PrototypeCar {
    PrototypeCar clone();
}

// Concrete Prototype: Cloning Cars
public class CloneableCar implements PrototypeCar {
    private String model;
    private String color;

    public CloneableCar(String model, String color) {
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color;
    }

    @Override
    public PrototypeCar clone() {
        return new CloneableCar(this.model, this.color);
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Car Model: " + model + ", Color: " + color);
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Singleton Pattern

Finally, let's implement the Singleton Pattern to manage the car inventory.

```java
// Singleton Class
public class CarInventory {
    private static CarInventory instance;

    private CarInventory() {}

    public static CarInventory getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new CarInventory();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public void displayInventory() {
        System.out.println("Displaying car inventory.");
    }
}
```

### Step 6: Demonstration of the Patterns

Now, let's create a demonstration to see these patterns in action.

```java
public class DesignPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using Abstract Factory
        Car sportsCar = CarFactory.createCar("sports");
        sportsCar.drive();

        Car suv = CarFactory.createCar("suv");
        suv.drive();

        // Using Builder Pattern
        CarBuilder carBuilder = new ConcreteCarBuilder();
        carBuilder.setEngine("sports");
        carBuilder.setBody("sports");
        Car customCar = carBuilder.build();
        customCar.drive();

        // Using Prototype Pattern
        CloneableCar originalCar = new CloneableCar("Tesla Model S", "Red");
        CloneableCar clonedCar = (CloneableCar) originalCar.clone();
        clonedCar.display();

        // Using Singleton Pattern
        CarInventory inventory = CarInventory.getInstance();
        inventory.displayInventory();
    }
}
```

### Output

```
Driving a sports car with SportsEngine engine and SportsBody body.
Driving an SUV with SUVEngine engine and SUVBody body.
Driving a sports car with SportsEngine engine and SportsBody body.
Car Model: Tesla Model S, Color: Red
Displaying car inventory.
```

### Explanation of Each Pattern

1. **Abstract Factory**:
    - **Purpose**: To create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
    - **Usage**: In our case, the `CarFactory` can create different types of cars (`SportsCarFactory` and `SUVCarFactory`) based on the requirements.

2. **Factory Method**:
    - **Purpose**: To define an interface for creating objects, but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
    - **Usage**: The `CarFactory` class determines which car type to create based on the input string.

3. **Builder**:
    - **Purpose**: To separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
    - **Usage**: The `ConcreteCarBuilder` allows us to build a `Car` step by step, providing flexibility for different configurations.

4. **Prototype**:
    - **Purpose**: To create new objects by copying an existing object (the prototype).
    - **Usage**: The `CloneableCar` can be cloned to create a new instance with the same attributes.

5. **Singleton**:
    - **Purpose**: To ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
    - **Usage**: The `CarInventory` manages the car inventory as a single instance throughout the application.

### Differences Between the Patterns

- **Abstract Factory** vs. **Factory Method**:
    - **Abstract Factory** creates families of related objects, while **Factory Method** focuses on creating a single product, allowing subclasses to define which class to instantiate.

- **Builder**:
    - This pattern is more about constructing complex objects step by step, while the previous patterns deal with object creation without worrying about the construction process.

- **Prototype**:
    - This pattern emphasizes cloning an existing object instead of creating a new one. It is particularly useful when object creation is expensive.

- **Singleton**:
    - Ensures only one instance of a class exists, unlike the other patterns that focus on object creation and structure.

### When to Use Each Pattern

- **Abstract Factory**: When you need to create multiple families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Factory Method**: When you want to delegate the responsibility of instantiation to subclasses, especially when the exact type of the object is determined at runtime.
- **Builder**: When constructing an object requires several steps, or when you need to create different representations of the same type of object.
- **Prototype**: When the cost of creating a new instance is high, or when you want to avoid the complexity of the constructor.
- **Singleton**: When you need to control access to shared resources or manage global states across the application.

This comprehensive example illustrates the implementation of various design patterns in a cohesive manner within a common scenario of car manufacturing.
