The **Chain of Responsibility** (CoR) pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows multiple handlers to process a request without knowing the handler that will ultimately handle it. The request is passed along the chain of handlers until one of them handles it. This pattern promotes loose coupling in the application by decoupling the sender of a request from its receivers.

### Key Components
1. **Handler Interface**: Defines the method to handle requests and a reference to the next handler in the chain.
2. **Concrete Handlers**: Implement the handler interface and process requests. They may either handle the request or pass it to the next handler.
3. **Client**: Initiates the request to a handler in the chain.

### Advantages
- **Loose Coupling**: The sender of the request is decoupled from the receiver.
- **Dynamic Chain**: The chain can be easily modified by adding or removing handlers.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each handler has a single responsibility.

### Industry-Related Example: E-commerce Order Processing System

In an e-commerce platform, orders might go through various stages of processing (e.g., validating payment, checking inventory, applying discounts). Each stage can be handled by a different handler in the chain.

### Implementation

```java
// Handler Interface
abstract class OrderHandler {
    protected OrderHandler nextHandler;

    public void setNextHandler(OrderHandler nextHandler) {
        this.nextHandler = nextHandler;
    }

    public abstract void handleOrder(Order order);
}

// Concrete Handler for Payment Processing
class PaymentHandler extends OrderHandler {
    @Override
    public void handleOrder(Order order) {
        if (order.isPaymentValid()) {
            System.out.println("Payment processed for order: " + order.getOrderId());
            if (nextHandler != null) {
                nextHandler.handleOrder(order);
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("Payment failed for order: " + order.getOrderId());
        }
    }
}

// Concrete Handler for Inventory Check
class InventoryHandler extends OrderHandler {
    @Override
    public void handleOrder(Order order) {
        if (order.isInStock()) {
            System.out.println("Inventory checked for order: " + order.getOrderId());
            if (nextHandler != null) {
                nextHandler.handleOrder(order);
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("Inventory unavailable for order: " + order.getOrderId());
        }
    }
}

// Concrete Handler for Discount Application
class DiscountHandler extends OrderHandler {
    @Override
    public void handleOrder(Order order) {
        System.out.println("Applying discount for order: " + order.getOrderId());
        // Apply discount logic
        if (nextHandler != null) {
            nextHandler.handleOrder(order);
        }
    }
}

// Order class
class Order {
    private String orderId;
    private boolean paymentValid;
    private boolean inStock;

    public Order(String orderId, boolean paymentValid, boolean inStock) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
        this.paymentValid = paymentValid;
        this.inStock = inStock;
    }

    public String getOrderId() {
        return orderId;
    }

    public boolean isPaymentValid() {
        return paymentValid;
    }

    public boolean isInStock() {
        return inStock;
    }
}

// Client code
public class ChainOfResponsibilityDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create handlers
        OrderHandler paymentHandler = new PaymentHandler();
        OrderHandler inventoryHandler = new InventoryHandler();
        OrderHandler discountHandler = new DiscountHandler();

        // Set up the chain
        paymentHandler.setNextHandler(inventoryHandler);
        inventoryHandler.setNextHandler(discountHandler);

        // Create an order
        Order order1 = new Order("123", true, true);
        Order order2 = new Order("124", false, true);
        Order order3 = new Order("125", true, false);

        // Process orders
        System.out.println("Processing Order 1:");
        paymentHandler.handleOrder(order1);
        
        System.out.println("\nProcessing Order 2:");
        paymentHandler.handleOrder(order2);
        
        System.out.println("\nProcessing Order 3:");
        paymentHandler.handleOrder(order3);
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Order Class**: Represents an order with attributes such as `orderId`, `paymentValid`, and `inStock`.
2. **Handler Classes**: Each concrete handler (`PaymentHandler`, `InventoryHandler`, `DiscountHandler`) processes the order and decides whether to pass it to the next handler.
3. **Client Code**: Sets up the chain of responsibility and processes multiple orders, demonstrating how different handlers manage various order processing scenarios.

### When to Use the Chain of Responsibility Pattern
- When multiple objects can handle a request, but the handler isn't known in advance.
- When you want to decouple the sender of a request from its handlers.
- When you want to add or change handlers dynamically without modifying the client code.
- When you need to process a request through a series of processing steps or handlers.

### Other Industry-Related Examples
1. **Customer Support Ticket System**: Different support agents handle various ticket categories (e.g., billing, technical support, account management). Each category can be represented as a handler.
2. **Logging System**: Different logging handlers (e.g., console logging, file logging, remote logging) can be used in sequence to handle log messages based on severity levels.
3. **Event Processing System**: Events can be processed by different handlers based on their type (e.g., user registration, purchase events, system alerts).

The Chain of Responsibility pattern helps create flexible and maintainable systems by promoting loose coupling and dynamic processing.
