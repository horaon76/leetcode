Certainly! Letâ€™s consider an **eCommerce** example where we integrate a payment gateway with a different interface than what the application expects.

### Scenario
In an eCommerce platform, the application is designed to process payments through a specific interface (`PaymentProcessor`). However, you want to integrate with a third-party payment gateway that has a different interface (`ThirdPartyPaymentGateway`). To bridge this gap, you can use the **Adapter Pattern**.

### Key Components
1. **Target**: The interface that the application expects (`PaymentProcessor`).
2. **Adapter**: The adapter class that implements the `PaymentProcessor` interface and adapts the `ThirdPartyPaymentGateway`.
3. **Adaptee**: The existing payment gateway that is incompatible with the `PaymentProcessor` interface (`ThirdPartyPaymentGateway`).

### Step 1: Define the Target Interface
```java
// Target interface
interface PaymentProcessor {
    void processPayment(double amount);
}
```

### Step 2: Define the Adaptee Class
```java
// Adaptee class (third-party payment gateway)
class ThirdPartyPaymentGateway {
    public void makePayment(double paymentAmount) {
        System.out.println("Payment of $" + paymentAmount + " processed through third-party gateway.");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Create the Adapter Class
```java
// Adapter class
class PaymentGatewayAdapter implements PaymentProcessor {
    private ThirdPartyPaymentGateway thirdPartyPaymentGateway;

    public PaymentGatewayAdapter(ThirdPartyPaymentGateway thirdPartyPaymentGateway) {
        this.thirdPartyPaymentGateway = thirdPartyPaymentGateway;
    }

    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        // Adapting the method call from the third-party gateway to the expected interface
        thirdPartyPaymentGateway.makePayment(amount);
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Client Code
```java
public class ECommerceApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Client wants to process a payment using the target interface
        PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor;

        // Using the adapter to integrate with the third-party payment gateway
        ThirdPartyPaymentGateway thirdPartyGateway = new ThirdPartyPaymentGateway();
        paymentProcessor = new PaymentGatewayAdapter(thirdPartyGateway);

        // Process payment through the adapter
        paymentProcessor.processPayment(99.99); // Output: Payment of $99.99 processed through third-party gateway.
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Target Interface (`PaymentProcessor`)**: This interface defines the method `processPayment(double amount)` that the eCommerce application expects to use for payment processing.
2. **Adaptee Class (`ThirdPartyPaymentGateway`)**: This class represents the third-party payment gateway with its own method, `makePayment(double paymentAmount)`, which is not compatible with the `PaymentProcessor` interface.
3. **Adapter Class (`PaymentGatewayAdapter`)**: This class implements the `PaymentProcessor` interface and contains an instance of `ThirdPartyPaymentGateway`. It adapts the `processPayment` method to call the `makePayment` method of the third-party gateway.
4. **Client Code (`ECommerceApplication`)**: In this class, the application creates an instance of `ThirdPartyPaymentGateway`, wraps it in the `PaymentGatewayAdapter`, and calls the `processPayment` method. The output confirms that the payment is processed through the third-party gateway.

### Advantages
- **Seamless Integration**: The Adapter Pattern allows you to integrate different payment gateways without changing the core payment processing logic in your eCommerce application.
- **Flexibility**: You can easily add new payment gateways by creating new adapter classes without modifying the existing codebase.
- **Code Reusability**: The adapter encapsulates the third-party logic, promoting reusability of the `PaymentProcessor` interface across different payment solutions.

### Use Cases in eCommerce
- Integrating multiple payment processors (like PayPal, Stripe, etc.) with a unified payment interface.
- Connecting different shipping service providers with a consistent shipping interface.
- Working with various inventory management systems using a common interface.

This example demonstrates how the Adapter Pattern helps create a flexible and maintainable eCommerce application that can easily adapt to new payment integrations.
