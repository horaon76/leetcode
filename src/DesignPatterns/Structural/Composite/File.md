The **Composite Pattern** is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with tree structures where individual objects (leaf nodes) and groups of objects (composite nodes) need to be treated in the same way.

### Key Components

1. **Component**: An interface or abstract class that defines the common interface for both the leaf and composite objects.
2. **Leaf**: A class that represents leaf nodes in the composition, which does not have any children.
3. **Composite**: A class that implements the Component interface and can contain children (both leaf and composite nodes).

### Benefits

- Simplifies client code by allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- Makes it easier to add new components to the system, as they can be added without modifying existing code.

### Example: File System

In this example, weâ€™ll create a simple representation of a file system, where both files and directories can be treated uniformly.

#### Key Components
- **Component**: `FileSystemComponent`
- **Leaf**: `File`
- **Composite**: `Directory`

#### Implementation

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Component
interface FileSystemComponent {
    void showDetails();
}

// Leaf
class File implements FileSystemComponent {
    private String name;

    public File(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("File: " + name);
    }
}

// Composite
class Directory implements FileSystemComponent {
    private String name;
    private List<FileSystemComponent> components = new ArrayList<>();

    public Directory(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void addComponent(FileSystemComponent component) {
        components.add(component);
    }

    public void removeComponent(FileSystemComponent component) {
        components.remove(component);
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("Directory: " + name);
        for (FileSystemComponent component : components) {
            component.showDetails();
        }
    }
}

// Client code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create files
        File file1 = new File("file1.txt");
        File file2 = new File("file2.txt");
        File file3 = new File("file3.jpg");

        // Create a directory and add files to it
        Directory directory1 = new Directory("Directory1");
        directory1.addComponent(file1);
        directory1.addComponent(file2);

        // Create another directory and add files and the first directory to it
        Directory directory2 = new Directory("Directory2");
        directory2.addComponent(file3);
        directory2.addComponent(directory1);

        // Show details of the directory structure
        directory2.showDetails();
    }
}
```

### Output
```
Directory: Directory2
File: file3.jpg
Directory: Directory1
File: file1.txt
File: file2.txt
```

### Explanation

1. **FileSystemComponent**: This interface represents the common interface for all components (both files and directories).
2. **File**: This class implements the `FileSystemComponent` interface and represents leaf nodes (individual files).
3. **Directory**: This class also implements the `FileSystemComponent` interface and can contain other `FileSystemComponent` objects, making it a composite node. It has methods to add and remove components.
4. **Main**: In the client code, we create several `File` and `Directory` objects, demonstrating the composite structure. When we call `showDetails` on the root directory, it recursively displays details of all files and subdirectories.

### Summary
The Composite Pattern allows you to create a unified interface for both individual objects and groups of objects, enabling you to work with complex tree structures in a simple and consistent manner. This pattern is widely used in scenarios like graphical user interfaces, file systems, and organizational structures.
